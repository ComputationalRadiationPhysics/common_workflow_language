To be able to run a common workflow language file (with .cwl format) one needs to install cwltool.
cwltool requires Python 3. So, you will need to upgrade your Python at least to version 3.x. Here’s how to do it:
On Supercomputer open a terminal and type:

which python
which python3

This will show you the location of any installed Python versions. If python3 is installed, 
it will show the path where it's located. 
If Python 3 is installed, you can also check the packages available for Python 3. For example:

python3 -m pip --version

This will confirm if pip is installed for Python 3, which is necessary for installing other packages (like cwltool).
If you have pip installed for Python 3, you can install CWL tools (e.g., cwltool) by running:

python3 -m pip install --user cwltool

The --user flag ensures that the package is installed for your user account without requiring admin privileges.

-"psutil" error
you might see a "psutil" error. The error you're encountering indicates that the Python header files required to build the psutil package are missing.
These files are necessary for compiling C extensions, which is what psutil needs.


You can create a virtual environment for Python and install the necessary packages there, which won’t require sudo privileges.

python3 -m venv myenv

then Activate the virtual environment (after log out, every time you want to run cwl files you need to load this env first):

source ~/myenv/bin/activate

First, upgrade pip inside your virtual environment:

pip install --upgrade pip

try to install psutil again:
 
pip install psutil

Now install cwltool (CWL reference implementation) using pip:

pip install cwltool

Once installed, you can verify the installation by running the following:

cwltool --version

If you see the version of cwltool, it means the installation was successful.
