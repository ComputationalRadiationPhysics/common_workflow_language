To run a common workflow language file (.cwl files), one must install cwltool which requires Python 3. So, We you need to upgrade the Python at least to version 3.x. To do that open a terminal and type:

which python3

It will show the path and location where the python3 is located. If Python 3 is installed, you can also check the packages available for Python 3. For example:

python3 -m pip --version

This will confirm if pip is installed for Python 3, which is necessary for installing other packages (like cwltool).
If pip is installed for Python 3, you can install CWL tools (cwltool) by running:

python3 -m pip install --user cwltool

The --user flag ensures the package is installed for your user account without requiring admin privileges.

Also, we need to load required modules, e.g. git. open the terminal and type

module load git

which shows all available git modules. just load one of them. To confirm which git is loaded on the terminal type: 

git --version
